# BRVIN 2 — Product Scope and Active Milestone Acceptance

**Status date:** 6 November 2026  
**Status authority:** [BRVIN_2_MASTER_PLAN.md](BRVIN_2_MASTER_PLAN.md)  
**As-built authority:** [BRVIN_SYSTEM_REFERENCE.md](BRVIN_SYSTEM_REFERENCE.md)

This document defines the active BRVIN product boundary and the final milestone ledger. It is not a chronological implementation diary. Older milestone drafts are not active requirements.

## 1. Approved product

BRVIN is a shared, application-aware knowledge platform for teacher-specific digital brains. It manages teacher knowledge sources and securely serves them to independently built applications.

BRVIN owns ingestion, OCR, indexing, projects, collections, source grants, trusted application/environment identity, app-project grants, private retrieval, quotas, audit events and connection verification.

The connected application owns end-user authentication, teacher/user-to-project mapping, model generation, prompts, conversation/session state and the final user experience. ChatGPT remains the user's engineer for application code, repository work, testing and deployment through separately authorized GitHub and Cloudflare connections.

## 2. In scope

- Protected administrator workspace for teacher knowledge and application connections.
- PDF upload, private storage, OCR, indexing, retrieval QA, readiness and retention.
- Shared D1 registry, shared AI Search namespace and central ingestion pipeline.
- Multiple applications and deployment environments with trusted identities.
- Explicit application-to-project grants, revocation and source-level authorization.
- Private same-account Cloudflare Service Binding RPC.
- Versioned v2 retrieval and one-time live connection verification, with v1 compatibility retained for current Fatman usage.
- Project-level usage/quota and specialist activity visibility.
- Administrator procedures and safe recovery.

## 3. Explicitly out of scope

- BRVIN autonomous coding agent, software Project Factory or automatic app/repository generation.
- BRVIN-owned app CI/CD, broad provider administrator credential vault or automatic provider-token rotation.
- A new D1 database, AI Search instance or ingestion/OCR pipeline per teacher or app.
- Public access to the private `brvin-service` Worker.
- Cross-account or non-Cloudflare retrieval gateway in the current delivery.
- BRVIN-owned model response generation or end-user authentication.
- A per-environment project grant model unless a later product decision justifies it.

## 4. Active final milestone ledger

M0–M5 are earlier implementation stages and are not open tasks in the current delivery. The active final sequence is M6–M11.

| Milestone | Scope | Current status | Evidence / acceptance |
|---|---|---|---|
| M6 | Teacher-focused admin workspace | **COMPLETE** | Knowledge projects, source visibility, administration and project-oriented workspace shipped. |
| M7 | Application/environment registry | **COMPLETE** | Applications, deployment environments and repository/runtime metadata registered in the shared D1 registry. |
| M8 | ChatGPT integration handoff | **COMPLETE** | Versioned, dated, non-secret repository/environment-specific integration handoff shipped. |
| M9 | Live connection verification | **COMPLETE** | Private challenge/proof flow accepted in production; Parmar AI Production is connected with one ready authorized source. |
| M10 | Teacher knowledge grants and isolation | **COMPLETE** | Grant/revoke controls, source-access shortcuts and two-application/project-isolation tests deployed and accepted. |
| M11 | Operations, usage and administrator handover plus real consumer acceptance | **COMPLETE** | Operations, lifecycle rule verification, authenticated admin walkthrough, useful consumer retrieval with PDF-page provenance, post-revocation denial and successful retrieval restoration after re-grant are verified. |

## 5. M11 acceptance detail

**M11 status: COMPLETE — 8 November 2026.**

### Completed and verified

- Operations summary displays monthly project searches, active-environment connection failures, failed activity events and OCR cleanup failures.
- Live pipelines reports active processing/deletion jobs and recoverable work.
- Specialist activity supports failure/warning, retention, connection, ingestion and governance filters.
- Protected read-only GCS diagnostic distinguishes object access, lifecycle-management permissions and the actual lifecycle rule.
- Five-minute retention supervisor checks/installs the exact 30-day OCR-only lifecycle rule while preserving unrelated rules and protecting source-PDF paths.
- Administrator confirmed **Lifecycle configuration permissions: READY** and **30-day OCR lifecycle rule: INSTALLED (age 30 days)**.
- OCR-only cleanup event history was reviewed. The latest visible completion stated that the original PDF and indexed search pages remain available. The event detail reported zero object versions found and zero deleted; no positive physical-deletion count is claimed.
- Authenticated Operations walkthrough completed on 6 November 2026. It reviewed Operational summary, Live pipelines, Failures and warnings, and Storage and OCR retention.
- BRVIN Teachers' Operator Console, tenant D1, classroom/collection/source UI and private bindings are deployed. The real teacher, Physics project, collection and 3-page PDF source are registered; the source is `READY` at 3/3 indexed pages.
- The Physics source's three page items were re-indexed from stored OCR under 256-token chunks with 10% overlap, with verified chunk counts 3/4/4 and no PDF re-upload or repeat Vision OCR operation.
- **Semantic retrieval passed:** the protected BRVIN Teachers v2 diagnostic returned two relevant Newton second-law passages, both citing physical PDF page 2 (displayed relevance scores 0.993 and 0.960).
- **Revocation denial passed:** after the Production app's access to Physics was revoked, a subsequent real consumer request displayed **Not Authorised**.
- **Restoration passed:** after the Physics access grant was restored, the same consumer successfully answered again. The user/operator confirmed both outcomes on 8 November 2026.
- The earlier one-time connection-proof snapshot recorded zero ready sources because it predated project/source creation; it is retained as historical connection evidence and does not supersede the later source-readiness and consumer tests.

The real-consumer M11 acceptance is complete. This documentation update does not change Core D1, grants, quota, Worker code, bindings or production deployment.

## 6. Deferred future work

A separately authenticated gateway for consumers outside the same Cloudflare account or outside Cloudflare may be considered later. It is deferred and not part of the completed M11 acceptance.

## 7. Delivery discipline

A milestone is complete only when the feature is implemented, automated checks pass, the production deployment/acceptance is verified where required, and the relevant current documents are updated. A documentation-only status update does not substitute for functional acceptance.

Use [BRVIN_2_MASTER_PLAN.md](BRVIN_2_MASTER_PLAN.md) for continuation instructions, [BRVIN_SYSTEM_REFERENCE.md](BRVIN_SYSTEM_REFERENCE.md) for current implementation facts, and [BRVIN_ADMIN_RUNBOOK.md](BRVIN_ADMIN_RUNBOOK.md) for administrator steps.


## 6. Planned retrieval-provider modernization (M12–M17)

M6–M11 remain complete and unchanged. The next planned sequence is defined in [BRVIN_RETRIEVAL_PROVIDER_MIGRATION.md](BRVIN_RETRIEVAL_PROVIDER_MIGRATION.md), which is the detailed acceptance and implementation authority for this workstream.

| Milestone | Scope | Status | Tracking |
|---|---|---|
| M12 | Architecture, trust boundaries, same-UI contract and migration gates documented in both repositories. | **COMPLETE — documentation only**  | [Core #141](https://github.com/ashini-x/parmar-ai/issues/141) |
| M13 | Core provider abstraction, deterministic chunking and immutable raw-OCR/source-page manifests; provider-boundary PR #147 is merged. The replay-reader/re-index acceptance is being completed with the M14 prerequisite branch. | MERGED — no production provider switch; corpus writes default-off; acceptance sign-off pending replay-reader merge  | [Core #142](https://github.com/ashini-x/parmar-ai/issues/142) |
| M14 | Non-production Vertex AI + Qdrant unified math-aware hybrid Physics pilot; recovered OCR is persisted and verified, then embed/index and evaluate dense+sparse/RRF retrieval. | IN PROGRESS — PRs #148–#160 merged; corpus read-back independently verified (3 pages/7 chunks, 2/2/3); staging Worker v`23f3b9a4` deployed with authenticated Qdrant index/evaluate routes; user must provision Qdrant Free cluster/API key and add the staging Vertex/Qdrant settings before live indexing | [Core #143](https://github.com/ashini-x/parmar-ai/issues/143) |
| M15 | AI Search vs Qdrant shadow benchmark including math/symbol fidelity, mixed-query quality, provenance, security, load, latency, cost and rollback. | PLANNED  | [Core #144](https://github.com/ashini-x/parmar-ai/issues/144) |
| M16 | Coordinated Core Admin and Teachers UI/consumer compatibility; preserve current workflows and v2 response contract. | PLANNED  | [Core #145](https://github.com/ashini-x/parmar-ai/issues/145) · [Teachers #18](https://github.com/ashini-x/brvin-teachers/issues/18) |
| M17 | Controlled canary/production cutover, monitoring, rollback, 14-day soak and only then explicit legacy retirement review. | PLANNED  | [Core #146](https://github.com/ashini-x/parmar-ai/issues/146) |

**No production provider cutover has been performed.** M13 provider-boundary PR #147 is merged to `main`; production still pins Cloudflare AI Search and keeps `BRVIN_CORPUS_MANIFEST_ENABLED=false`. M14 PRs #148–#160 are merged. The original Vision JSON was deliberately deleted by post-READY retention, so the staging operator regenerated OCR once from the retained PDF into the isolated M14 bucket. The resulting generation `57129957231e548064e5594d8fb9f501` has been independently read back and verified: 3 physical pages, 7 chunks (2/2/3), raw OCR hashes, normalized-text hashes and deterministic chunk metadata all pass. The staging Worker now includes authenticated Vertex/Qdrant indexing and three known-evidence retrieval checks. The remaining user action is to provision the separate Qdrant Cloud cluster and add its URL/API key plus the fixed Vertex settings to the staging Worker. No live embedding request or Qdrant upsert/query has been executed yet. The v2 API, D1 authorization and consumer-owned final answer generation remain unchanged until the applicable acceptance gates are passed.
